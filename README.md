## **Singa Metro Authority (SMA) Fare Calculator**
This project implements a fare calculation system for Singa Metro Authority's (SMA) public transport. Commuters can calculate their total fares based on the lines traveled, time of travel (peak/non-peak), and daily/weekly fare caps. The design is flexible, enabling the future addition of new lines, rules, and stations.
