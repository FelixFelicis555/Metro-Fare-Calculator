## **Singa Metro Authority (SMA) Fare Calculator**
This project implements a fare calculation system for Singa Metro Authority's (SMA) public transport. Commuters can calculate their total fares based on the lines traveled, time of travel (peak/non-peak), and daily/weekly fare caps. The design is flexible, enabling the future addition of new lines, rules, and stations.

## **🚀 Features**
- **Dynamic Fare Calculation**: Calculates fares based on the line combinations  and peak/non-peak hour rules.
- **Fare Caps**: Implements daily and weekly caps to ensure fair pricing.
- **CSV Input Suppor**t: Reads journey data from a CSV file for bulk fare processing.
- **Configurable Peak Hours**: Peak hours are defined in a centralized configuration file for easy updates.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily extendable to handle new fare rules, lines, and stations.
